Questions for Conference Call:
•	Will the competition be monitored or will we just login anything during the four days and execute our 5 runs? Will it be open for runs 24 hours a day?
•	What do we do if we have a problem with the simulation?
•	Do you know what the expected real time factor is going to be?
•	The bandwidth limits. Are those in ROS time or Wall Clock time? Same question for the latency time.
•	Can we get some example tc commands that we can use to test the latency and bandwidth limits?
•	There are several topics that do not provide data. Can we get a list of topics that will be providing good data for us to use? Or a list of topics that we should not use or that may not be working at the competition?
